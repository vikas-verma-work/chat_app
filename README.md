Sample Electron app with react that demonstrates the following:

Multiple Processes: Set up both the main process (parent) and one or more Node processes (child).

Inter-Process Communication: Showcase interaction between the parent and child processes using Electron's IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms.

The app should demonstrate clear communication, such as sending messages or data from the child to the parent and vice versa.

Deliverables:

A working Electron app with the required functionality.

A brief explanation of how the communication works in your app.
